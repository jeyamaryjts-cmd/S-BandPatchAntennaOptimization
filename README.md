S-Band Microstrip Patch Antenna Optimization

This repository hosts the entire project focused on designing and optimizing rectangular microstrip patch antennas for the S-band frequency range (2–4 GHz), which is vital for military and communication applications. The goal is to analyze how different substrate materials (FR-4 and Rogers RT) and their thicknesses impact antenna performance, specifically gain and bandwidth.

What You’ll Find Here

Simulation Data: Results from electromagnetic simulations performed in CST Studio Suite, capturing return loss, VSWR, gain, and bandwidth for various substrate thicknesses.

Machine Learning Models: Python scripts and trained models that predict antenna performance at fine increments, enabling rapid design exploration and optimization without the need for time-consuming simulations every time.

Comparison Analysis: Side-by-side evaluation of commonly used FR-4 against high-performance Rogers RT substrate materials to help identify cost-effective designs without compromising performance.

Visualization: High-quality plots that demonstrate how substrate choices affect antenna characteristics, supplemented with ML-driven predictive visualizations.

Why This Matters

Optimizing antennas traditionally involves running many complex simulations, which can be time-consuming and costly. By integrating machine learning, this project significantly speeds up the design process and helps engineers quickly find the best antenna configurations tailored for challenging S-band applications, from military communications to satellite systems.
